                <h2>Volunteer</h2>
                <p>Volunteering is one of the best ways to give back to the coastline you know and love. By volunteering to participate in an organized cleanup, or simply picking up trash on your own when you’re enjoying the local beaches, you help clean the beaches we all see and enjoy on a daily basis. </p>
                
                <p>In addition to participating in an organized cleanup, taking other small actions on your own can help the cause as well. Wearing a t-shirt, voicing your concerns to your beach’s Surfrider representative, or fundraising are important ways to contribute as well. </p>
                
                <p>If you’re interested in volunteering with Surfrider, contact one of our local beach representatives, a member of our Core Team, or visit us on Facebook and send us a message with your details. </p>
                
                <p>You can also report any illegal dumping to the core. Direct them to the local rep. Surfrider email address for now. 
                </p>
