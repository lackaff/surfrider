						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>A group of passionate surfers started Surfrider in 1984 as a way to put and end to pollution in the water they surfed in and loved so much. Tom Curren, three-time world surfing champion, started a new life in France and noticed the terrible state of the beaches. As a response, he created the European headquarters of Surfrider Foundation in 1990 in Biarritz (France).  </p>

<p>Since that time, Surfrider Foundation employees and thousands of people have chipped in over the battle to keep the oceans clean. Their contributions over the years allow us to bathe and surf without risking our own health. Surfrider Foundation has headquarters in all major parts of the world, but in plenty of smaller communities like Ericeira as well.</p>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>

<p>Surfrider Ericeira works to ensure a clean ocean and environment in different ways.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We visit schools and help teachers and children understand the importance of living a sustainable lifestyle. That means using making good choices for the land and water around our home.</li> 
		<li>We help clean beaches so families and surfers can enjoy the coast in a safe, healthy way for everyone involved</li>

						<h2>Sustainable Surfing</h2>
						<p>Though the action of riding a wave is environmentally friendly, there are ways the lifestyle and industry associated with it can be improved to have less negative impact on the environment. Here are some of Surfrider’s quick tips to surfing sustainably. </p>

						<ul>
							<li>Purchase your equipment from companies that localize production. Despite how well a product may be made by a certain brand, the petroleum involved in transport can pose a significant threat to the health of the environment. </li>
							<li>Choose to purchase from brands who place emphasis on using materials that are good for the environment. Manufacturers can reduce the toxicity of surfboard and wetsuit production by using alternative materials instead. By opting to support companies that do with your purchase, you help spur a small amount of change in the industry. </li>
							<li>Shop locally from retailers who deal with waste and energy use responsibly. It’s great if a surfing business caries great products, but if it’s reckless in how it disposes of the waste that comes with those materials, you’re just contributing to more toxic waste from the surfing industry. </li>
							<li>Make less surf trips and drive less. If you have the option to surf a full day once a week versus one hour five days a week, you can significantly reduce the amount of fuel you use in travel. </li>
							<li>Seek out more ways to create less waste on your own. Be as wary of the impact you have on the environment as you can. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>By following these tips, you can help make sure the waters you choose to surf in are clean and healthy for you, your friends and the rest of the surfing community. </p>
